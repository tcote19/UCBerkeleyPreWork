	<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Matt Johnson, born 3 February 1969 in Bournemouth, England, is a British keyboardist who plays for the Funk Rock/Acid Jazz band Jamiroquai.</p>

		<p>Johnson was aged one and a half when he started playing the piano at his family home. "My dad was a musician, so there was always music playing in the house; but I remember being taught by a scary old piano teacher, who must have been over 90 years old". His influences range from Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis through to Squarepusher.</p>

		<p>Before playing in Jamiroquai, Johnson was a widely respected writer and performer for bands Sunray with whom Kym Mazelle recorded a cover of "Perhaps" and Nu Hope. He has also written and produced songs for artists such as Alexia, who had a minor hit with "Ring".</p>

		<p>His route into Jamiroquai was via an audition in 2002. He was recommended by Simon Katz, a previous guitarist, and Derrick gave him the call. The audition was a success, and Matt is now a well established writer and member of the Jamiroquai family.</p>

		<p>Johnson has also had a stint as the chief songwriting partner and producer along with a Jamiroquai bandmate, guitarist Rob Harris for singer songwriter Julian Perretta, helping him create his debut album, Stitch Me Up, which was released in 2011.</p>

		<p>Matt joined Jamiroquai on 2 May 2002, replacing the prestigious founding member Toby Smith as keyboardist.</p>
